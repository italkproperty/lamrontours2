KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY,,,,
,,,,
Factor,Industry Standard,Lamron’s Opportunity or Threat,Strategic Action,"To compete effectively, Lamron Tours and Safaris should:"
Quality,"Tour operators compete on well-maintained vehicles, knowledgeable guides, high-standard accommodations, and safety",Emerging operators can struggle to match the polish of older brands,"Partner with high-quality lodges, train guides intensively, ensure vehicle reliability, and showcase this in your content",Stand out on service and customization
Price,"Mid-range operators dominate (N$10,000–N$35,000 per tour); luxury brands go higher; budget tours cut features","Price-sensitive segments look for value, not just low prices","Offer transparent pricing with tiered packages (budget, comfort, premium) and flexible payment terms",Build trust through social proof and transparency
Advertising,"Top players invest in SEO, Instagram, Google Ads, and international travel partnerships",Smaller companies often under-invest or rely only on social media,"Focus on organic growth via social proof (testimonials, user-generated content), Instagram Reels, and Google Ads targeting foreign markets",Offer smart pricing tiers to appeal to different budgets
Research & Development (R&D),Limited industry-wide innovation; most packages are standard (Etosha–Sossusvlei–Swakop combo),"Opportunity to stand out by offering unique routes, cultural immersion, or themed safaris (photography, wellness)","Continuously test new tour types, guest experiences, and cross-sector collaborations (e.g., Airbnb stays, rural tourism)","Invest in creative, authentic content marketing"
Customer Service,"Premium operators offer 24/7 support, airport pickups, concierge-style service; budget operators are inconsistent",Many players lose customers due to poor communication or inflexibility,"Win customers with fast responses on WhatsApp, tailored planning, and proactive follow-ups pre- and post-trip",Innovate with new safari angles — not just repeat what others do
